| Day | Title | Takeaways |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | Sonar Sweep | 1. In *Python*, `file.read()` returns the entire content of file as a string, whereas `file.readlines()` returns a list where each item is a line from file<br>2. `string.strip()` returns a copy of the string with both leading and trailing characters removed |
| 2 | Dive | 1. Using `.replace()` and `.split()` to split the input by two delimiters and store the resulting input into a list |
| 3 | Binary Diagnostic | 1. `Part 1` uses comprehension to count the number of ones and the number of zeros in each bit position<br>2. `int(string, 2)` converts a binary string to a decimal integer<br>3. `Part 2` implements recursion to solve the puzzle<br>4. *CAVEAT:* If we declare two lists as `A = B = []` in *Python*, and even if we just modify list `A` later, the list `B` will be modified accordingly |
| 4 | Giant Squid | 1. **OOP** comes into play at this puzzle <br>2. Everytime we want to initialize class variables and their types, we need to have `from __future__ import annotations` at the top<br>3. A `class method` should have `cls` as input parameter and can only be called by a class, whereas a `property` can be called by an object(class instance) <br>4. The way to convert a 2D `list` into a `set`: `set.union(*map(set, list))`<br>5. `set.discard(number)` is a built-in method, which removes the number from the set<br>6. `*parameter` is used to denote the parameter can have 0 or more elements<br>7. According to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2970722), we should use named tuples instead of tuples anywhere we think object notation will make our code more pythonic and more easily readable.<br>8. Make sure to have `from typing import NamedTuple` on the top when we want to implement named tuple<br>9. `for/else` loop also comes into play at this puzzle, the `else` statement will only be executed when the `for` loop completes normally(e.g. no `break` is encountered in this puzzle) |
| 5 | Hydrothermal Venture | 1. There are two ways to find the maximum in a 2D list: `max(map(max, list_name))` and `numpy.array(list_name).max()`*(That's why `numpy` can make your life easier, eh?)*<br>2. `while (x, y) != (x_end, y_end)` creates a loop until both x and y satisfy their conditions, it is useful when `x` and `y` needs to be modified with the same number of times<br>3. Think of combining `range()` and `min(), max()` when we need to determine the increment is `1` or `-1`. For example: `range(min(x, y), max(x, y) + 1)` |
